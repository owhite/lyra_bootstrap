                                                    that can separate student from instructor are broken down. In these ways, students see a slightly different part of the teacher, which helps them feel more comfortable with the online classroom experience.</p>

                                                    writing instruction. As more and more universities turn to technology-mediated instruction for their writing classes, writing studies scholars and practitioners need more examples of research-based,
                                                    pedagogically-sound classroom practices. Nowhere is this more vital than in the area of synchronous online writing instruction. More analysis of and conversation about synchronous online writing instruction,
                                                    especially when mediated by web conferencing systems, or “virtual classrooms,” is needed to better understand the unique attributes, affordances, and constraints of this complex learning environment.&nbsp;<br><br>The
                                                    bulk of the research on synchronous online instruction primarily analyzes synchronous chat applications, though researchers have begun to study more robust web conferencing systems and their impact on
                                                    student satisfaction and success (McDaniels, Pfund, &amp; Barnicle, 2016; Giesbers et al., 2014; Martin, Parker, &amp; Deale, 2012; Rockinson-Szapkiw, 2012; Falloon, 2011; de Freitas &amp; Neumann, 2009;
                                                    Schutt, Allen, &amp; Laumakis, 2009) as well as pedagogical strategies and challenges to consider (Cornelius, 2014; Bower, 2011). None of the literature that addresses synchronous online writing instruction,
                                                    however, considers the synchronous online writing classroom in the context of a blended course. The research conducted outside of writing studies on the impact of synchronous teaching interventions on
                                                    student satisfaction and success is promising, but we do not yet know how their findings may translate to writing courses. We need a better understanding of how the synchronous online environment can
                                                    be leveraged in writing courses to foster an accessible, interactive, and supportive community of inquiry (Ehmann &amp; Hewett, 2015; Garrison, Anderson, &amp; Archer, 2000).<br><br>This webtext will

                                                    of synchronous online teaching with four video recordings from former classes. Through these Artifacts, I demonstrate how web conferencing and collaborative word processing platforms can be used to bolster

                                                    2016). The bulk of the literature on hybrid learning comes from Education and Distance Education research. In these fields, researchers use “blended learning.” Writing Studies and f Online Writing Instruction
                                                    (OWI) have adopted “hybrid learning,” however, so I use our term throughout this webtext.<br>Hybrid learning scholars and practitioners maintain that hybrid learning isn’t merely a “best of both worlds”
                                                    approach; it’s an entirely new approach altogether (Bonk &amp; Graham, 2006; Garrison &amp; Vaughan, 2008; McGee &amp; Reis, 2012; Stein &amp; Graham 2013). As Garrison and Vaughan (2008) attest, hybrid
                                                    learning “is a fundamental redesign that transforms the structure of, and approach to, teaching and learning” (5). Bonk and Graham (2006) also use this language, explaining that “transforming blends
                                                    allow a radical transformation of the pedagogy” such that they “enable intellectual activity that was not practically possible without the technology” (13). This “radical transformation of the pedagogy”
                                                    is what animates much of OWI scholarship on hybrid pedagogy (see especially Hewett &amp; Warnock, 2015; Snart, 2015; and Snart, 2010).&nbsp;<br>Despite such unbridled enthusiasm for hybrid learning to
                                                    transform our pedagogy, too many hybrid practitioners remain trapped by traditional notions of what can, or “should,” happen in-person and online. Distance Education scholarship overwhelmingly assigns
                                                    active learning to the face-to-face environment and reflective learning to the online environment (Alberts, Murray, &amp; Stephenson, 2010; Garrison &amp; Vaughan, 2008). For example, the face-to-face
                                                    environment is privileged for building group cohesion (So &amp; Brush, 2008) and providing “social and emotional support” (Picciano, 2009)<strong> </strong>while the online environment is heralded for
                                                    its ability to foster critical thinking and reflection through asynchronous discussion forums (Garrison &amp; Kanuka, 2004).&nbsp;<br>We see this bifurcation in Writing Studies, as well. In his 2016
                                                    <em>Computers and Composition </em>article, Jason Dockter investigates why his online teaching presence was not as effective as he had thought, even after ten years of developing his online pedagogy
                                                    (p. 82). As he analyzes Michael G. Moore’s transactional distance theory (1997), Dockter considers the constraints of his online course in light of the affordances of face-to-face courses: “face to face,
                                                    learner autonomy can increase due to the opportunities for immediate dialogue between participants, an increased number of participants sharing an immediate experience, [and] an increased ability to
                                                    alter a class session spontaneously” (p. 77). Here, Dockter links learner autonomy to immediacy, and affordance that asynchronicity, by its very definition, cannot provide. In so doing, Dockter reinforces
                                                    the narrative that online environments often compromise the teacher-student and student-student relationships we deeply value.<br>This narrative likely perseveres because hybrid and online learning scholarship
                                                    is rooted in online pedagogies that predate Web 2.0 technology. Dockter himself, in the above-quoted section, moves from Moore to OWI scholarship published in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Yet today’s
                                                    hybrid (and online) learning classes look vastly different than they did twenty years ago. Our understanding of what today’s hybrid classes can and do look like is necessary step towards eradicating
                                                    unhelpful bifurcations of “online” and “onsite” place- and time-based learning and their traditionally assigned pedagogies.<br><br>Synchronous Online Learning Environments (SOLEs)<br><br>Synchronous
                                                    online learning environments (SOLEs) are those in which students and instructors meet together at the same time while physically separated. These classes are most often mediated by “virtual classrooms,”
                                                    or web conferencing platforms. Platforms built for synchronous online meetings include LMS platforms such as Blackboard’s Elluminate and Canvas’s BigBlueButton; robust, business-oriented platforms like
                                                    Adobe’s Connect and Cisco’s WebEx, and more widely-available platforms such as GoToMeeting and Zoom<em>. </em>Web conferencing systems such as these can be used in tandem with other tools like Google
                                                    Documents (hereafter referred to as Google Docs) to facilitate highly interactive, collaborative classes that are ideal for writing courses.&nbsp;<br>In hybrid classes that reserve the online class day
                                                    and time in students’ schedules just like in-person classes, instructors have the option to conduct their online classes asynchronously or synchronously. This gives instructors and students three primary
                                                    classroom environments: the brick and mortar classroom, the asynchronous online environment, and the synchronous online environment. While they are discrete environments, the boundaries between can be—and
                                                    ought to be—porous. Designed well, each of the three learning environments can inform the others to create a tightly integrated and cohesive course, especially when the online environment is expanded
                                                    to incorporate technologies that enable—and pedagogies that promote—immediacy and interactivity (Hilliard &amp; Stewart, 2019).&nbsp;<br>For example, conversations that begin in person can be extended
                                                    in online discussion forums and Twitter; textual analysis can be conducted independently through social annotation tools such as hypothes.is or Kami and discussed synchronously in breakout rooms or in
                                                    person; group activities conducted in Google Docs can begin in online breakout rooms and finish in-person; peer review can be broken down into separate stages that are sequenced across all three learning
                                                    environments so that students benefit from instant verbal (and nonverbal) feedback in person, more carefully considered, written feedback conducted asynchronously and posted online; and live sentence-level
                                                    edits of each other’s near-final drafts synchronously in Google Docs.&nbsp;<br>By widening the view from the single class session to the week or unit in which that class occurs, we can see how the SOLE
                                                    can be implemented to “enable intellectual activity that was not practically possible without the technology” (Bonk &amp; Graham, 2006, p. 13). As such, I submit that teaching writing in the synchronous
                                                    online environment is an example of CCCC OWI Principle #3: “Appropriate composition teaching/learning strategies should be developed for the unique features of the online instructional environment,”
                                                    and specifically, “New pedagogies should be explored and implemented to leverage the inherent benefits of the electronic environment in relation to composition instruction” (CCCC OWI 2013). We will examine
                                                    these pedagogies further in each of the Artifacts.<br>&nbsp;<br></p>

                                                    2016; Bower, 2011) to concerns about access and inclusion (Mick &amp; Middlebrook, 2015; Hewett 2013) to scheduling challenges (Snart 2015; Giesbers et al.. 2014; Melkun, 2011; Rockinson-Szapkiw, 2012;
                                                    Falloon, 2011). Others are more pedagogical, noting the significant learning curve teachers face in order to learn how to navigate comfortably, let alone effectively, in web conferencing platforms such
                                                    as Adobe Connect, Elluminate, and WebEx (Stewart, 2017; Mick &amp; Middlebrook, 2015; Cornelius 2014; Bower 2011; Schullo et al., 2007; Hewett &amp; Ehmann 2004).&nbsp;TechnologyI concede that these
                                                    are not small concerns. The success of the synchronous online learning environment is contingent on multiple technological factors working properly, which remains daunting even in the second decade of
                                                    the 21st century. Students—and instructors—can and do suddenly get kicked out of web conferencing systems for no apparent reason. Even more accessible platforms like Google Docs are not infallible: the
                                                    native chat feature in Docs is only available to those signed in with a Google account. While all students at my institution have Google accounts through their university emails, many students don’t
                                                    use these accounts. When they open their Google Docs, they appear as anonymous “Jackal” or “Walrus” and can’t access the Chat feature. I then need to remind them to sign into their Google account and
                                                    re-enter their group Google Docs in order to fully participate in the activity as designed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In addition, the synchronous online environment by its very nature is precarious, for its effectiveness
                                                    is only as good as everyone’s Internet connection, including the instructor’s. Even campus-based students who rely on the university’s well-supported wireless network are at the mercy of sudden connectivity
                                                    failures. We can encourage students to use broadband access or a more stable wireless network, but that’s impractical. Students should be able to access their virtual classrooms with the minimum amount
                                                    of cognitive overhead possible.&nbsp;<br>AccessAn even greater barrier to synchronous online teaching is one of resources. I have the privilege of being at a well-funded institution invested in providing
                                                    instructors access to expensive programs like Adobe Connect or WebEx (much to my chagrin, my institution replaced Adobe Connect with WebEx in 2017). As of this writing, I have begun experimenting with
                                                    Zoom, a modestly-priced application available without an institutional license that has a friendlier interface than WebEx. Yet Zoom has its own limitations; I cannot, for example, upload files to share
                                                    with students. I instead need to share my screen in its entirety, which interferes with my view of the interface. And as of the time of this publication, none of the available alternatives to WebEx allow
                                                    facilitators to create additional chat boxes and layouts in advance of the session.<br>I also enjoy the benefits of longevity in a highly supportive department. I was part of the team that redesigned
                                                    our FYC course for the hybrid format, which we would pilot in the spring of 2012. During our fall 2011 planning sessions, I learned about the web conferencing feature available in our then-LMS. While
                                                    my colleagues were not interested in exploring synchronous online teaching, our team leader, who was also our FYC program director at the time, allowed me to try it in my sections. I’ve been coordinating
                                                    our hybrid and online FYC courses since 2013; over the years, I’ve convinced and mentored several of my colleagues to teach some of their online classes synchronously. They can do this because, with
                                                    the help of our department’s scheduling coordinator, we’ve increased the number of hybrid FYC courses that lock the online class day in the registration system. Students can’t register for a discussion
                                                    section or lab during their online class time; those 75 minutes are automatically reserved for their English class. Without this registration lock, synchronous online teaching would be impossible.&nbsp;<br>I
                                                    am acutely aware that synchronous online teaching is improbable for many instructors, especially those without access to the types of resources described above. At the same time, I’ll humbly offer that
                                                    improbable doesn’t have to mean impossible. Furthermore, no learning environment is impervious to technological problems. In brick-and-mortar classrooms, the projector may not work, or the Internet may
                                                    be down—or students haven’t read or done their homework, making the planned lesson impossible to facilitate. In asynchronous online environments, we can and occasionally do forget to publish a page in
                                                    the LMS, or set up an assignment incorrectly, or send an announcement with incorrect information.&nbsp;<br>When faced with these challenges face-to-face, the transactional distance is low, yet we need
                                                    to troubleshoot the problem on the fly. Asynchronously online, the transactional distance is high: we’re at the mercy of students contacting us to alert us to the problem, which they don’t always do.
                                                    Synchronously online, the transactional distance is lower. Technological problems may feel scarier, for we can’t see our students’ faces, so we can’t gauge their willingness to stay present while we
                                                    troubleshoot the problem. Yet even when I get kicked out of the web conferencing platform entirely, it only takes about fifteen seconds to get back in. And, while hardly ideal, if students get kicked
                                                    out, they can watch the recording of the session later, which is not something they can do with face-to-face classes.&nbsp;<br><br>Synchronous AffordancesStudent Engagement (Social Presence)<br><br>The
                                                    affordances of the synchronous online environment enable students to engage with each other, the material, and the instructor in different ways than they can face-to-face or asynchronously online. Brunk-Chavez
                                                    and Miller (2006) state simply “that a digitized class creates and maintains shared spaces in ways that a f2f classroom cannot” (“Collaboration in Action”). As the artifacts demonstrate, the ability
                                                    of students to talk with each other during a presentation enhances social presence in a way that is not possible face-to-face. Many students feel more comfortable writing to each other in front of everyone
                                                    instead of speaking in front of everyone in class. Students get to know each other in different ways synchronously online, which strengthens their connections to each other when they work with each other
                                                    face-to-face.&nbsp;<br>Immediate Feedback&nbsp; (Cognitive Presence)The instant feedback I am able to provide to students’ in-class work is incomparable to what is possible face-to-face. To be sure,
                                                    I can and do respond to students’ work face-to-face, but walking around the room and giving feedback to work in 19 notebooks or laptops is very different than giving feedback to work in a single shared
                                                    space. In person, unless students are working in a Google Doc that is projected onto a screen, there’s no way students can see and hear me respond to one student’s work <em>while seeing that student’s work exactly like I am. </em>I
                                                    cannot overemphasize this advantage. It’s the one that students most frequently comment on in their end-of-semester course evaluations. Being able to see what everyone else is doing helps them check
                                                    for understanding even before I do, increasing both cognitive presence and learner autonomy. By comparing their responses to each other’s, students are quickly able to see if they’re on track, or, in
                                                    one student’s words, “if you’re doing it right.” Moreover, by creating multiple opportunities for students to share their work—both prepared work that they did for homework and can copy and paste into
                                                    the chat and new work that they’re asked to do in real time—along with everyone else, students are quickly accustomed to sharing their work in front of their peers, an invaluable advantage in a writing
                                                    class that extensively uses peer review.<br>Students share their work in front of each other in Google Docs, as well. While many of my Google Doc activities are group activities, some are independent.
                                                    I may ask students to do some invention work during class, and I have them do so in Google Docs so that I can check for understanding as they’re working. Again, this would be impossible face-to-face.
                                                    It is possible asynchronously, of course, but I’m not going to be able to respond to them instantly; it may take me up to 24 hours to do so, which, frankly, is too late for invention work. The kairotic
                                                    moment has passed. Having them complete small, in-class writing activities and exercises in Google Docs emphasizes time on task, one of Chickering and Gamson’s (1987) widely-cited effective practices.
                                                    It also demonstrates that this work matters enough to be seen and returned to when they prepare the next stage of the larger assignment that the exercise supports.&nbsp;<br><br>Instructor Ethos (Teacher
                                                    Presence)<br><br>Finally, teaching synchronously online gives students a chance to see me in a different way than they do face-to-face. I like to think that I am a friendly, accessible instructor, though
                                                    I know that both my age and the inherent power imbalance separates me from my students more than I’d like to admit. Seeing me in my home office gives students a peek into who I am outside of the formal,
                                                    brick-and-mortar classroom. They frequently hear emergency vehicle sirens outside of my window, as I live in the heart of a major city. They see my cluttered bulletin board and my books. They see my
                                                    cats when they wander into the room and jump up to my desk, as they are wont to do. In these ways, students see a slightly different part of me, which I like to believe helps them feel more comfortable
                                                    when they see me in person or in my on-campus office.<br>I believe that it is my responsibility as an educator to figure out how best to meet students’ needs using all available means. This means continually
                                                    experimenting with everything—lesson plans, assignments, activities—and, as a blended teacher, environments. As Melkun (2012) writes, “Web conferencing techniques, like courses, improve with every iteration.
                                                    As instructors, we expect to continually revise the content and delivery of our courses. The same process applies to our use of learning technologies. We must observe how these technologies are being
                                                    used by our students, develop best practices, and continually improve on those practices” (138). I don’t always get it right—far from it—but I always do my best to do so.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p>If you ask a child to paint a picture of the sun, you will most likely get a bright yellow circle on a piece of paper. This is actually quite accurate, given that the sun is a ball of hot gas and that its surface (called the photosphere)
                        mostly shines in bright yellow light. The yellow colour is determined by the temperature of the photosphere, which is about 5,500°C.In fact, the sun sometimes looks pretty much exactly like a child’s drawing. During a solar eclipse,
                        the sun’s outer atmosphere, called the solar corona, can actually be seen as a bright circle, with the moon blocking the rest of the sunlight. Like the sun below, the corona consists of plasma – a gas of charged particles.</p>
